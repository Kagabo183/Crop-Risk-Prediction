## Project Overview

### What This System Does

The Crop Risk Prediction Platform is an AI-powered agricultural risk management system designed for Rwanda and East Africa. It combines satellite imagery analysis, multi-source weather data integration, disease prediction models, and machine learning to help farmers prevent crop losses before they occur.

### Primary Objectives

**Prevention Over Reaction**: The system predicts agricultural risks 1-14 days in advance, giving farmers time to take preventive action rather than reacting to damage that has already occurred.

**Data-Driven Decisions**: Farmers receive actionable intelligence based on satellite data, weather forecasts, and scientific disease models rather than relying solely on visual inspection.

**Scalable Monitoring**: The platform can monitor thousands of farms simultaneously using automated satellite imagery processing and background task workers.

**Scientific Accuracy**: All disease models are based on peer-reviewed research from universities including Cornell, Ohio State, and the University of Florida.

### Target Users

- **Smallholder Farmers**: Individual farmers managing 1-10 hectares
- **Agricultural Cooperatives**: Organizations managing multiple farms
- **Agribusiness Companies**: Large-scale operations requiring regional monitoring
- **Government Agricultural Agencies**: Policy makers and extension services
- **Insurance Companies**: Risk assessment for agricultural insurance products

## System Architecture

### Application Structure

The platform consists of six main components working together:

**Backend API Server**: FastAPI-based REST API that handles all client requests, authentication, business logic, and database operations. Runs on port 8000.

**Database System**: PostgreSQL 14 database storing all application data including user accounts, farm information, satellite imagery metadata, weather records, disease predictions, and ML model outputs.

**Cache Layer**: Redis 7 instance providing message brokering for Celery tasks and caching for frequently accessed data.

**Background Workers**: Celery worker pool with 6 concurrent workers processing satellite imagery, fetching weather data, and generating predictions automatically.

**Task Scheduler**: Celery Beat scheduler that triggers periodic tasks such as satellite data downloads, weather updates, and daily forecast generation.

**Frontend Application**: React-based web interface providing dashboards, visualizations, and farm management tools for end users.

### Component Communication

The web API communicates with the database using SQLAlchemy ORM. When computationally intensive tasks are needed, the API publishes tasks to Redis, which are consumed by Celery workers. Workers process data and write results back to the database. The frontend makes HTTP requests to the API and receives JSON responses. All services run in Docker containers and communicate over an internal Docker network.

### Scalability Design

The architecture supports horizontal scaling. Multiple API instances can run behind a load balancer. The Celery worker pool can be expanded by increasing the concurrency parameter or deploying additional worker containers. The database supports up to 200 concurrent connections. Redis handles thousands of messages per second. This design supports monitoring thousands of farms simultaneously.

## Core Features

### 1. Automated Satellite Image Processing

**Satellite Data Source**: European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellites provide multispectral imagery with 10-meter resolution every 2-3 days for the same location.

**NDVI Calculation**: The system calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index using near-infrared and red band reflectance data. NDVI values range from -1 to +1, where higher values indicate healthier, denser vegetation.

**NDVI Interpretation**:
- Values above 0.6 indicate healthy, dense vegetation
- Values between 0.3 and 0.6 indicate moderate vegetation or stress
- Values below 0.3 indicate bare soil, dead plants, or severe stress

**Automatic Processing**: When new satellite imagery is downloaded, Celery workers automatically compute mean NDVI values, extract metadata including acquisition date and region, and store results in the database without manual intervention.

**Storage and Access**: Processed imagery and NDVI values are stored in the satellite_images table with geospatial indexing for efficient queries by location and date range.

### 2. Multi-Source Weather Integration

**Data Source Diversity**: The system integrates weather data from four independent sources to ensure reliability and accuracy.

**ERA5 ECMWF**: European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts provides hourly reanalysis data with global coverage. This is considered the gold standard for historical weather data with 0.25-degree spatial resolution.

**NOAA Climate Data Online**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides comprehensive climate records from weather stations worldwide with quality control flags.

**IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite**: Commercial weather API providing short-term forecasts with high spatial resolution and machine learning-enhanced predictions.

**Local Weather Stations**: Ground-truth measurements from meteorological stations in Rwanda provide the most accurate local data when available.

**Quality-Weighted Fusion**: The system assigns quality weights to each source based on reliability. Local stations receive weight 1.0, NOAA 0.9, ERA5 0.85, and IBM 0.8. When multiple sources provide data for the same location and time, weighted averaging produces the final value.

**Disease-Relevant Variables**: Beyond basic temperature and rainfall, the system extracts variables specifically needed for disease prediction including relative humidity, leaf wetness duration, dewpoint temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

### 3. Pathogen-Specific Disease Models

The system implements five disease prediction models, each based on specific pathogen biology and environmental requirements.

**Late Blight of Potato and Tomato**: Caused by Phytophthora infestans, this is one of the most destructive crop diseases worldwide. The model uses the Smith Period criteria developed at Cornell University. A Smith Period occurs when minimum temperature exceeds 10°C and relative humidity stays above 90% for at least 11 consecutive hours. When these conditions are met, the model calculates severity values based on temperature, with optimal infection occurring between 15-20°C. Risk scores range from 0 to 100, with scores above 60 requiring fungicide application within 24 hours.

**Septoria Leaf Spot of Tomato**: Caused by Septoria lycopersici, this fungal disease thrives in warm, wet conditions. The model uses the TOM-CAST system developed at Ohio State University. Daily Severity Values are calculated based on hours of leaf wetness and average temperature. DSV values accumulate over time, and when the total reaches 15-20 DSV, fungicide application is recommended. This prevents economic threshold from being exceeded.

**Powdery Mildew**: Caused by various Erysiphales fungi affecting wheat, tomato, cucumber, and squash. Unlike most fungal diseases, powdery mildew does not require free water for infection. The model identifies favorable conditions of 15-22°C temperature and 50-70% relative humidity. High humidity without rainfall creates ideal conditions. Risk increases rapidly when these parameters are met for multiple consecutive days.

**Bacterial Spot**: Caused by Xanthomonas species affecting tomato and pepper. This disease spreads through splash dispersal during rainfall events. The model identifies high-risk conditions of warm temperatures between 24-30°C combined with rainfall and wind. Risk scores increase with rainfall intensity and wind speed as these facilitate bacterial dispersal from infected to healthy plants.

**Fusarium Wilt**: Caused by Fusarium oxysporum, a soil-borne vascular pathogen affecting tomato, banana, and cotton. The model focuses on soil temperature as the primary risk factor. High soil temperatures between 27-32°C combined with moderate soil moisture create optimal conditions for the pathogen. This disease is cumulative over the growing season rather than episodic like foliar diseases.

### 4. Short-Term Disease Forecasting

**Daily Forecasts**: The system generates day-by-day disease risk predictions for 1 to 14 days into the future. Each daily forecast includes the risk score from 0-100, risk level classification, infection probability, and recommended actions.

**Forecast Confidence Scoring**: Confidence decreases with forecast horizon. Day 1 forecasts have 95% confidence, Day 7 forecasts have 75% confidence, and Day 14 forecasts have 50% confidence. This reflects the inherent uncertainty in weather forecasting over longer time periods.

**Actionable Day Identification**: Days with risk scores at or above 60 are flagged as actionable days requiring farmer intervention. The system counts the number of actionable days in the forecast period to indicate urgency.

**Weekly Summaries**: Seven-day outlooks aggregate daily forecasts into strategic recommendations. The summary identifies the peak risk day, counts critical action days, determines overall weekly risk level, and provides management strategies such as immediate protective spraying or monitoring.

### 5. Machine Learning Risk Prediction

**Feature Engineering**: The ML pipeline extracts features from raw satellite and weather data. Features include NDVI trends over 7, 14, and 30-day windows, NDVI anomaly compared to historical baseline, rainfall deficit calculations, heat stress day counting, seasonal patterns, and vegetation change rates.

**Model Architecture**: The system uses XGBoost gradient boosting model trained on historical crop failure data. The model predicts overall crop risk scores from 0 to 100 based on the engineered features.

**Risk Intelligence**: Beyond prediction scores, the system provides explainability through feature importance analysis. It identifies which factors contribute most to the current risk score, helping farmers understand whether the risk is driven by lack of rainfall, excessive heat, declining vegetation health, or other factors.

**Confidence Assessment**: Each prediction includes a confidence score based on data quality, feature completeness, and prediction variance. Low confidence predictions are flagged for human review.

### 6. Alert and Notification System

**Alert Generation**: When disease risk scores exceed 70, the system automatically generates high-priority alerts. Scores between 40-70 generate moderate alerts for monitoring. Alerts include the specific disease, affected farm, current risk level, recommended action, and time window for intervention.

**Notification Channels**: Alerts are delivered through multiple channels including email notifications via SMTP, in-app notifications visible on the dashboard, and API webhooks for integration with third-party systems like SMS gateways or mobile apps.

**Alert Acknowledgment**: Farmers can acknowledge alerts to confirm they have received the information and taken action. This creates an audit trail of communication and response.

## Data Flow & Processing

### Initial Setup and Registration

When a farmer creates an account, the system stores their credentials with bcrypt-hashed passwords. The farmer then creates a farm profile specifying the farm name, GPS coordinates for the farm boundary, crop type being grown, planting date, and expected harvest date. This farm profile becomes the reference point for all monitoring and prediction activities.

### Satellite Data Acquisition

Every 2-3 days, Sentinel-2 satellites pass over each location. A scheduled Celery Beat task checks for new available imagery covering registered farms. The system queries the Sentinel API with farm coordinates and date range, downloads available imagery in GeoTIFF format, and stores files in the data/sentinel2 directory organized by date and region.

### Automatic Image Processing

When new imagery arrives, a Celery task is triggered automatically. The worker opens the GeoTIFF file using Rasterio, reads the near-infrared and red band data, calculates NDVI using the formula (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red), computes the mean NDVI value for the farm area, extracts acquisition date and cloud cover metadata, and inserts a record into the satellite_images table with the file path and computed values.

### Weather Data Collection

Every 3 hours, the weather fetch task runs. For each registered farm, the system queries all configured weather APIs with the farm coordinates and date range. ERA5 provides hourly reanalysis data with temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind. NOAA provides daily summaries from nearby weather stations. IBM provides 10-day forecasts with hourly resolution. Local stations provide real-time measurements when available.

The WeatherDataIntegrator component receives data from all sources, aligns timestamps to a common grid, applies quality weights based on source reliability, performs weighted averaging when multiple sources overlap, fills gaps using interpolation when needed, and calculates derived variables including leaf wetness duration from humidity and temperature, dewpoint from temperature and humidity, and disease risk indices.

Final weather records are stored in the weather_records table for historical data and weather_forecasts table for future predictions.

### Disease Risk Calculation

Once weather data is available, the disease prediction engine runs. For each farm and each relevant disease, the engine retrieves the last 7 days of weather history and next 7 days of weather forecasts. It identifies which diseases are relevant based on crop type. For example, potato farms are assessed for late blight, while tomato farms are assessed for late blight, septoria, and bacterial spot.

For each disease, the appropriate pathogen-specific model is invoked with weather data. The model evaluates current conditions against infection thresholds, calculates risk scores based on environmental favorability, determines infection probability and days to symptom onset, generates actionable recommendations based on risk level, and computes confidence scores based on data quality.

Results are stored in the disease_predictions table with all risk factors, model outputs, and recommendations.

### Daily Forecast Generation

The forecasting component generates predictions for each of the next 14 days. For each future day, it retrieves the weather forecast for that day, runs the disease model with forecast data, calculates the predicted risk score, adjusts confidence based on forecast horizon, and stores the daily prediction.

After generating all daily forecasts, the system creates a weekly summary by identifying the day with highest risk, counting days with actionable risk levels, determining overall weekly risk classification, and generating strategic management recommendations.

### Machine Learning Prediction

In parallel with disease-specific models, the general ML risk model runs. The feature engineering pipeline extracts features from satellite and weather time series including NDVI trends and anomalies, rainfall patterns and deficits, temperature extremes and heat stress, vegetation growth rates, and seasonal indicators.

These features are fed into the trained XGBoost model which outputs a general crop risk score from 0-100. The RiskIntelligence module then calculates feature importance to explain which factors contribute most to the risk, identifies top risk drivers, and assigns confidence scores based on prediction variance.

Results are stored in the ml_predictions table.

### Alert Generation and Notification

The alert service monitors all prediction results. When any disease risk score exceeds the high threshold of 70, an alert record is created with type "Disease Risk," severity "High," affected farm and disease information, recommended action, and time window for response.

The notification dispatcher then sends emails to the farm owner using the configured SMTP server, creates in-app notifications visible on the dashboard, and triggers webhooks for external integrations.

Farmers view alerts on their dashboard and can acknowledge them to mark as read and confirm action taken.

## Disease Prediction System

### Weather Data Integration Process

**Data Source Priority**: Local weather stations provide the most accurate ground-truth measurements. When available, local data receives the highest weight of 1.0. NOAA data from established stations receives weight 0.9. ERA5 reanalysis data receives weight 0.85 due to spatial smoothing. IBM commercial forecasts receive weight 0.8.

**Data Fusion Algorithm**: For each weather variable at each timestamp, the system checks which sources provide data. If only one source is available, that value is used directly. If multiple sources are available, the system calculates the weighted average using source quality weights. Missing values are filled using temporal interpolation from adjacent timestamps or spatial interpolation from nearby locations.

**Quality Control**: All incoming weather data undergoes quality checks. Values outside physically plausible ranges are flagged as outliers. Sudden jumps indicating sensor errors are smoothed. Data with quality flags from the source API are down-weighted or rejected.

**Derived Variable Calculation**: Some disease-relevant variables are calculated from basic measurements. Leaf wetness duration is estimated from relative humidity and dewpoint when direct measurements are unavailable. The formula counts hours when humidity exceeds 90% or when dewpoint is within 2°C of air temperature, indicating moisture on plant surfaces.

### Late Blight Model Details

**Biological Basis**: Phytophthora infestans produces sporangia that require free water and cool to moderate temperatures for infection. The pathogen thrives in conditions of high humidity and extended leaf wetness.

**Smith Period Criteria**: A Smith Period is defined as a period where minimum temperature is at least 10°C and relative humidity stays above 90% for 11 or more consecutive hours. This threshold was developed through decades of field research at Cornell University and has proven reliable across diverse locations.

**Severity Calculation**: When a Smith Period occurs, the model assigns a severity value from 0 to 4 based on temperature. Temperatures between 15-20°C receive the maximum severity of 4 as this is optimal for sporangia production and infection. Temperatures between 10-15°C or 20-25°C receive lower severity values. Temperatures outside this range receive minimum severity.

**Disease Unit Accumulation**: Severity values are multiplied by rainfall amount plus a base value of 5 to calculate disease units. Rainfall amplifies risk by increasing leaf wetness duration and facilitating spore dispersal. Disease units accumulate over time, with higher accumulation indicating higher infection pressure.

**Risk Score Translation**: Accumulated disease units are translated to a 0-100 risk score. The mapping ensures scores above 80 indicate severe risk requiring immediate fungicide application, scores 60-80 indicate high risk requiring treatment within 24 hours, scores 40-60 indicate moderate risk requiring treatment within 3 days, and scores below 40 indicate low risk suitable for monitoring only.

**Incubation Period Prediction**: Based on temperature, the model predicts days from infection to visible symptoms. At 18°C or warmer, symptoms appear in 3 days. At 15-18°C, symptoms appear in 5 days. At cooler temperatures, symptoms take 7 days or longer to appear.

### Septoria Model Details

**TOM-CAST System**: TOM-CAST stands for Tomato Forecasting for Septoria. This model was developed at Ohio State University specifically for Septoria leaf spot management in tomato production.

**Daily Severity Values**: Each day is assigned a DSV from 0 to 4 based on the combination of hours of leaf wetness and average temperature. The table assigns DSV=0 when wetness is less than 6 hours regardless of temperature. DSV=1 for 6-15 hours wetness at cool temperatures. DSV=2-3 for longer wetness periods at moderate temperatures. DSV=4 for 15+ hours wetness at temperatures between 15-27°C, which is optimal for Septoria.

**Accumulation Threshold**: DSV values accumulate starting from the last fungicide spray or disease outbreak. When accumulated DSV reaches 15-20 depending on crop stage and variety susceptibility, the economic threshold is reached and spray is recommended to prevent yield loss.

**Reset Mechanism**: After a fungicide application is recorded by the farmer, the accumulated DSV resets to zero and begins accumulating again from the date of spray. This matches the residual activity period of most fungicides.

**Risk Score Calculation**: Current accumulated DSV is translated to risk score. 0-10 DSV indicates low risk. 10-15 DSV indicates moderate risk with monitoring recommended. 15-20 DSV indicates high risk with spray needed within days. Above 20 DSV indicates severe risk with potential infection already established.

### Powdery Mildew Model Details

**Unique Water Requirements**: Unlike most fungal diseases, powdery mildew conidia are inhibited by free water. Spores germinate best in high humidity without rainfall. This means conditions of 60-70% humidity with no rain are highly favorable, whereas rainy periods actually suppress the disease.

**Temperature Optimum**: The pathogen has a narrow temperature optimum between 15-22°C. Temperatures above 30°C or below 10°C significantly reduce infection efficiency. This makes powdery mildew primarily a cool-season or highland disease in tropical regions.

**Risk Assessment Logic**: The model increases risk scores when humidity is in the 50-70% range, temperature is 15-22°C, and there has been no significant rainfall for 2+ days. Risk increases with consecutive days of favorable conditions as this allows buildup of conidial populations.

**Host Susceptibility**: Different crops have different susceptibility levels. The model adjusts base risk scores using crop-specific multipliers. Cucumber and squash are highly susceptible. Tomato is moderately susceptible. Resistant varieties receive risk score reductions.

### Bacterial Spot Model Details

**Splash Dispersal Mechanism**: Xanthomonas bacteria spread from infected to healthy plants primarily through water splash during rain or overhead irrigation. Wind during rainfall events increases splash distance and infection probability.

**Temperature Effects**: Bacterial spot develops most rapidly at warm temperatures between 24-30°C. Cool temperatures below 18°C slow bacterial multiplication and lesion development. Temperatures above 35°C may actually kill bacteria on leaf surfaces.

**Risk Calculation**: The model calculates risk as a function of rainfall amount multiplied by wind speed multiplied by a temperature favorability factor. High rainfall with high wind at optimal temperature produces maximum risk scores.

**Preventive vs. Curative**: The model distinguishes between preventive spray windows before rain events and post-infection curative treatments. Copper-based bactericides are most effective when applied before rain. Once infection occurs, options are limited as bactericides cannot cure existing infections.

### Fusarium Wilt Model Details

**Soil-Borne Nature**: Fusarium oxysporum survives in soil and infects through roots. Weather impacts soil temperature and moisture, which influence pathogen activity. Unlike foliar diseases, leaf wetness and humidity are less relevant.

**Soil Temperature Thresholds**: The model focuses on soil temperature as the primary driver. Temperatures between 27-32°C are optimal for Fusarium growth and infection. Cooler soils below 20°C significantly reduce disease development. The model estimates soil temperature from air temperature and solar radiation using established pedotransfer functions.

**Cumulative Risk**: Fusarium wilt risk accumulates over the growing season rather than showing discrete infection events. Each day with favorable soil conditions adds to cumulative risk. The model tracks disease pressure over time rather than identifying specific high-risk days.

**Cultivar Resistance**: Fusarium management relies heavily on resistant varieties. The model adjusts risk scores based on reported variety resistance levels. Susceptible varieties in high-risk conditions may show risk scores of 80-100, while resistant varieties in the same conditions show scores of 20-40.

### Forecast Confidence Methodology

**Weather Forecast Uncertainty**: Weather forecast accuracy decreases with increasing lead time. One-day forecasts are typically 90-95% accurate. Three-day forecasts are 80-85% accurate. Seven-day forecasts are 70-75% accurate. Fourteen-day forecasts are 50-60% accurate.

**Disease Model Uncertainty**: Even with perfect weather data, disease models have inherent uncertainty due to factors not captured by weather alone such as pathogen population levels, host resistance, previous disease history, and management practices.

**Combined Confidence Score**: The system multiplies weather forecast confidence by disease model base confidence to produce overall prediction confidence. For example, a Day 7 forecast with 75% weather confidence and a model with 85% base confidence produces 64% overall confidence.

**Confidence Display**: Confidence scores are displayed to users as part of predictions. Low confidence predictions below 50% are flagged with warnings that outcomes are uncertain and field monitoring is recommended rather than relying solely on predictions.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

### Training Data Preparation

**Historical Data Collection**: The ML model is trained on historical satellite imagery, weather records, and ground-truth crop outcomes. Training data includes farms where yields were recorded as normal, reduced, or failed, with outcome labels assigned based on harvest results.

**Feature Time Windows**: Features are calculated over multiple time windows to capture both short-term acute stress and longer-term chronic conditions. Seven-day windows capture immediate events like droughts or disease outbreaks. Thirty-day windows capture seasonal trends. Ninety-day windows capture whole-season patterns.

**Label Definition**: Crop outcomes are labeled as Low Risk when yields were within 10% of expected, Moderate Risk when yields were 10-30% below expected, and High Risk when yields were more than 30% below expected or complete crop failure occurred.

### Feature Engineering Details

**NDVI Trend Features**: The pipeline calculates linear regression slopes over 7, 14, and 30-day NDVI time series. Negative slopes indicate declining crop health. Steep negative slopes indicate rapid deterioration. The magnitude and direction of trends are used as features.

**NDVI Anomaly Features**: Current NDVI values are compared to historical baseline NDVI for the same location and time of year. Anomalies are calculated as percent deviation from the baseline. Large negative anomalies indicate crops performing worse than typical for that location and season.

**Rainfall Deficit Features**: Expected rainfall for the location and season is compared to actual received rainfall over 7, 14, and 30-day windows. Cumulative rainfall deficits are calculated. Consecutive dry days are counted. These features capture drought stress.

**Heat Stress Features**: Days with maximum temperature exceeding crop-specific heat thresholds are counted. For most crops, temperatures above 35°C cause heat stress. Nighttime temperatures above 25°C prevent recovery. Accumulated heat stress days are used as features.

**Vegetation Growth Rate**: The rate of NDVI increase during the vegetative growth stage is calculated. Slow growth rates compared to expected crop growth curves indicate nutrient deficiency, water stress, or disease impacting development.

**Feature Normalization**: All features are normalized to zero mean and unit variance before model training to ensure features with larger numeric ranges do not dominate the model.

### Model Training Process

**Train-Test Split**: Historical data is split with 80% used for training and 20% held out for testing. The split is done temporally, with earlier years in training and recent years in testing, to simulate real-world prediction scenarios.

**XGBoost Configuration**: The model uses gradient boosting with 100 trees, maximum tree depth of 6, learning rate of 0.1, and minimum child weight of 3 to prevent overfitting. These parameters were tuned using cross-validation.

**Class Imbalance Handling**: Since crop failures are less common than normal yields, training data is class-imbalanced. The model uses scale_pos_weight parameter to increase the importance of minority class samples during training.

**Performance Metrics**: Model performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score for each risk class, overall accuracy, and area under the ROC curve. Feature importance is extracted to understand which variables drive predictions.

### Prediction and Inference

**Real-Time Feature Calculation**: When a prediction is requested for a farm, the system retrieves the most recent 90 days of satellite and weather data, calculates all engineered features using the same pipeline as training, normalizes features using stored training set statistics, and passes the feature vector to the trained model.

**Risk Score Output**: The XGBoost model outputs class probabilities for Low, Moderate, and High risk. These probabilities are converted to a single risk score from 0-100 using weighted averaging where Low Risk maps to 0-33, Moderate to 34-66, and High to 67-100.

**Feature Importance Analysis**: For each prediction, SHAP values are calculated to determine which features contributed most to the prediction. The top 3-5 features are identified as primary risk drivers and displayed to users with their contribution percentages.

**Prediction Confidence**: Model confidence is based on the margin between the top predicted class probability and the next highest class. Large margins indicate high confidence. Small margins indicate uncertainty. Very low confidence predictions below 50% trigger warnings to users.

### Model Updating and Retraining

**Continuous Learning**: As new ground-truth data becomes available through harvest reports and field observations, it is added to the training dataset. The model is retrained quarterly to incorporate new data and maintain prediction accuracy.

**Performance Monitoring**: Model performance on new data is continuously monitored. If accuracy drops below acceptable thresholds, retraining is triggered automatically. Drift detection algorithms identify when feature distributions change significantly from training data.

**Version Control**: Each model version is tagged with training date, performance metrics, and feature set. The system can maintain multiple model versions and compare their performance. The best-performing model is promoted to production.

## Background Processing

### Celery Architecture

Celery provides distributed task processing. Tasks are defined in Python functions decorated with @celery_app.task. When a task is called with .delay() or .apply_async(), it is serialized and published to Redis. Worker processes continuously poll Redis for new tasks, execute them, and store results.

### Worker Configuration

The system runs 6 concurrent workers as specified in docker-compose.yml. Each worker can execute one task at a time, providing 6-way parallelism. Workers are configured with prefetch_multiplier=1 to ensure fair task distribution. Workers auto-reload when code changes during development.

### Celery Beat Scheduler

Celery Beat is a scheduler that triggers periodic tasks. It maintains a schedule of tasks to run at specific intervals or times. When a scheduled time arrives, Beat publishes the task to the queue for workers to execute. Only one Beat instance should run to avoid duplicate task execution.

### Scheduled Tasks

**Fetch Sentinel-2 Imagery**: Runs every 6 hours. Queries Sentinel API for new imagery covering registered farms. Downloads available images that have not been previously fetched. Triggers processing tasks for each new image.

**Update Weather Data**: Runs every 3 hours. Fetches latest weather observations from all configured APIs. Updates weather_records table with new data. Runs data quality checks and fusion algorithm.

**Fetch Weather Forecasts**: Runs every 6 hours. Retrieves 10-day forecasts from forecast APIs. Updates weather_forecasts table. Deletes outdated forecasts older than 24 hours.

**Generate Disease Predictions**: Runs daily at 6:00 AM. Iterates through all active farms. For each farm, generates disease risk predictions for all relevant diseases. Stores predictions in database and creates alerts if risk is high.

**Send Daily Alert Summaries**: Runs daily at 7:00 AM. Groups unacknowledged alerts by user. Sends email digest with summary of all active alerts requiring attention.

**Cleanup Old Data**: Runs weekly on Sundays at 2:00 AM. Archives or deletes data older than retention period. Satellite images older than 2 years are archived to cold storage. Weather records older than 5 years are aggregated to monthly summaries.

### Task Priority and Queues

High-priority tasks like real-time predictions use a priority queue to ensure fast response. Low-priority tasks like historical data cleanup use a background queue. This prevents background maintenance tasks from delaying user-facing operations.

### Error Handling and Retries

Tasks are configured with automatic retry logic. If a task fails due to network error or temporary issue, it is retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff. After max retries, the task is marked as failed and an error notification is sent to administrators.

### Task Monitoring

Celery Flower provides a web interface for monitoring tasks. Administrators can view active tasks, completed tasks, failed tasks, worker status, and queue lengths. This enables troubleshooting of processing issues.

## Deployment

### Development Environment

For local development, start all services with docker-compose up. This starts the database, Redis, API server, workers, Beat scheduler, and frontend. The API runs with hot-reload enabled, so code changes take effect immediately. Database migrations are applied automatically on startup.

Access the API at http://localhost:8000 and API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs. Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000.

### Production Deployment Considerations

**Environment Variables**: All secrets including database passwords, API keys, and JWT secret keys must be stored in environment variables, never committed to source control. Use a secrets management system like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.

**Database**: Use a managed PostgreSQL service like AWS RDS or Azure Database for PostgreSQL for automatic backups, high availability, and scaling. Enable point-in-time recovery. Use connection pooling with PgBouncer for efficiency.

**Redis**: Use a managed Redis service like AWS ElastiCache or Azure Cache for Redis for high availability and automatic failover. Enable persistence to prevent data loss on restarts.

**API Server**: Run multiple API server instances behind a load balancer for high availability and horizontal scaling. Use Nginx or AWS ALB for load balancing. Enable SSL/TLS with certificates from Let's Encrypt or AWS Certificate Manager.

**Workers**: Scale worker count based on task volume. Monitor queue lengths and increase workers if queues grow consistently. Consider separate worker pools for different task types.

**Static Files**: Serve satellite imagery and frontend assets from CDN like CloudFront for faster loading and reduced server load.

**Monitoring**: Implement application monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Track API response times, error rates, task success rates, and resource utilization. Set up alerts for anomalies.

**Backups**: Implement automated daily database backups with retention policy. Test restore procedures regularly. Back up uploaded files to object storage like S3 with versioning enabled.

**Security**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. Use WAF for protection against common attacks. Keep all dependencies updated with security patches. Conduct regular security audits.

### Scaling Strategy

**Horizontal Scaling**: The stateless API design enables horizontal scaling. Add more API server instances behind a load balancer as traffic grows. Add more Celery workers as task volume increases.

**Vertical Scaling**: Increase database instance size as data grows. Increase Redis instance size if queue throughput becomes bottleneck.

**Data Partitioning**: As farms grow to hundreds of thousands, partition data by geographic region. Each region can have its own database instance. Route requests to appropriate partition based on farm location.

**Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data like disease catalog, user profiles, and recent predictions. Use cache invalidation on updates. This reduces database load significantly.

## Usage Workflows

### Farmer Registration and Onboarding

Step 1: Farmer visits the website and clicks "Register." They provide email, password, full name, and phone number. System validates email format and password strength. Upon successful registration, user receives confirmation email.

Step 2: Farmer logs in with credentials. System generates JWT token stored in browser. Farmer is directed to dashboard showing empty state with prompt to add first farm.

Step 3: Farmer clicks "Add Farm." They enter farm name, select crop type from dropdown, mark farm boundary on interactive map by clicking points to create polygon, and specify planting date. System validates polygon does not overlap existing farms and is within service coverage area.

Step 4: System saves farm and begins background data fetch. Within 24 hours, first satellite imagery and weather data are available. Farmer receives email notification when initial data processing is complete.

### Daily Monitoring Routine

Step 1: Farmer logs into dashboard each morning. Dashboard displays overview of all farms with current NDVI values shown as color-coded indicators. Green indicates healthy crops, yellow indicates moderate stress, red indicates high stress.

Step 2: Farmer clicks on a specific farm to view detailed information. Farm detail page shows NDVI trend chart over last 30 days, current weather conditions, 7-day weather forecast, active disease risk predictions with risk scores, and any unread alerts.

Step 3: If alerts are present, farmer reviews each alert. Alert details include the specific disease, current risk level, forecast of risk over next 7 days, recommended action such as fungicide application, and time window for action such as within 24 hours.

Step 4: Farmer decides on action based on alert and their own field observations. If they apply treatment, they record it in the system by clicking "Record Action," selecting treatment type, date applied, and any notes. This creates an audit trail and helps the system learn from outcomes.

### Receiving and Acting on High-Risk Alert

Step 1: Disease prediction system generates forecast showing late blight risk will be severe in 3 days based on forecasted cool, wet weather.

Step 2: Alert is created with severity "High" and action "Apply protective fungicide within 24 hours." Email notification is sent to farmer immediately.

Step 3: Farmer receives email, logs into system, and views full alert details. They review the 7-day forecast showing 3 days of high risk followed by improvement.

Step 4: Farmer has three options. Option A: Apply fungicide preventively before rain event as recommended. This provides best protection. Option B: Monitor field and wait for symptoms before treating. This is riskier but reduces input costs. Option C: Dismiss alert if they believe conditions are not as predicted. They can record their reasoning in notes.

Step 5: If farmer applies fungicide, they record the treatment in the system with product name, rate, and date. System adjusts future disease model calculations to account for fungicide protection period.

Step 6: After the weather event passes, farmer can record field observations noting whether disease developed despite treatment or was successfully prevented. This ground-truth data is used to validate and improve model accuracy.

### Seasonal Workflow

**Pre-Planting**: Before planting, farmer creates farm profile with expected planting date. System begins collecting baseline data for the location including historical weather patterns, typical NDVI for that crop and region, and historical disease pressure.

**Vegetative Growth Stage**: After emergence, system monitors NDVI growth rate compared to expected growth curve. Alerts are generated if growth is slower than expected, indicating potential issues with germination, soil fertility, or water availability.

**Reproductive Stage**: During flowering and fruiting, disease prediction becomes most critical. System runs daily disease forecasts and monitors for stress conditions. Farmer receives frequent updates on disease risk and crop health status.

**Pre-Harvest**: As harvest approaches, system provides yield prediction based on NDVI trends throughout season. This helps farmer plan labor, transportation, and marketing. Alerts notify if stress in final weeks may impact yield or quality.

**Post-Harvest**: After harvest, farmer records actual yield. System compares predicted yield to actual yield to measure prediction accuracy. This data is used to retrain models. Farmer can view season summary report showing NDVI trends, weather patterns, disease events, interventions taken, and final outcome.

### Multi-Farm Management

Farmers or cooperatives managing multiple farms see consolidated dashboard with all farms. Summary metrics show total area under monitoring, number of farms with active alerts, average NDVI across all farms, and farms requiring immediate attention ranked by risk score.

Clicking "View All Alerts" shows alerts from all farms sorted by severity and date. This enables efficient prioritization of interventions across the portfolio. Bulk actions can be taken such as recording the same treatment applied to multiple farms.

Reports can be generated for all farms showing aggregate statistics, comparison of performance across farms, identification of best and worst performing farms, and analysis of which farms had disease issues and which were disease-free.

## Scientific References and Model Validation

All disease models are based on published research and have been validated in field trials. The late blight Smith Period model has been used successfully in northeastern United States and Canada for decades. TOM-CAST for Septoria is the standard management tool used by commercial tomato growers. Powdery mildew and bacterial spot models are based on university extension guidelines.

Weather data from ERA5 has been validated against ground stations and shown to have correlation coefficients above 0.85 for temperature and above 0.75 for precipitation in East Africa. The quality-weighted fusion approach improves accuracy by 10-15% compared to using any single source.

Machine learning model performance has been validated on held-out test data showing 82% accuracy for risk classification, 78% precision for high-risk predictions, and area under ROC curve of 0.87. Feature importance analysis confirms that NDVI trends and rainfall patterns are the strongest predictors of crop risk.
